* ComposeTeX

** Introduction:

When on Linux, there is a decent chance that you will want to type mathematical symbols from LaTeX within plaintext situtaions. Are you in a lecture for Discrete Math? What about writing a simple README file for your project? No matter the situation, Linux is a slight disadvanage.

In windows, you have access to tools like AutoHotKey for live keyboard replacements or LaTeX symbols via a script available here: [[https://gist.github.com/kbauer/e8fee6514d124d5961f51fd7ba571bfd]]

On Linux, you can't run AutoHotKey natively, which makes this solution a bit more difficult. Luckily, on many desktop managers, you have access to XCompose. This is a =.XCompose= file that contains a list of all the symbols you can type and binds them to various keybinds.

** Installation:

Simply download the file and place it in your =HOME= directory named =.XCompose=.

** Symbols

I will be using this website as a reference when making the LaTeX symbols table: [[https://latex.wikia.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_symbols#Greek_letters]]
